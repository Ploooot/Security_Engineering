# Task 1: Safety Concerns

## Why are new safety concerns sometimes overlooked?

Unfortunately, a lot of companies overlook some safety concern because they can blame the user if there is an issue with the use. It can also be because people would trust a system which is promoted as a safe system and they believe it. User of tesla often think there cars are fully autonomous which is not true. They would show less interest into getting safe by staying focus about traffic while the drive is driving itself. This is because they trust the brand, and trust can lead to a lack of precaution from user.

## What are events that trigger sudden change?

Events that trigger sudden change are usually about trust for safety. One example could be the one from the video Security Engineering Lecture 13: Safety and Security. In this video, we have the example of a huge brand of car which has been hacked. Using the driving assistant, the hacker made the car slowing down enough to create traffic before making the car going out of the road. After this event, people would never trust the autonomous system of the car so the brand had to call back all same model cars.

# Task 2 : Static and Dynamic Analyzers

Static and dynamic analyzers are two types of software testing tools used to guarantee the quality and security of software products, which operate in different ways.

Static analyzers examine source code or software without executing it. They focus on examining code structure, syntax and other features to identify potential vulnerabilities, errors or inefficiencies. Static analysis tools can detect problems such as violations of coding standards, security flaws and potential bugs. They are effective at detecting problems early in the development process, ensuring that problems are detected before code is executed.

On the other hand, dynamic analyzers evaluate software at runtime. They monitor the program's behavior in real time, tracking how it interacts with various system components and external elements. Dynamic analysis tools are able to detect runtime errors, memory leaks, performance bottlenecks and other problems that can only be observed at runtime. They provide information on actual software behavior, helping developers to identify and solve problems that would not have arisen during static analysis.

There are several advantages to using these tools during production. Firstly, they enable potential problems to be identified and resolved early on in the development process, reducing the cost and effort associated with fixing bugs at later stages. Secondly, they help to improve the overall quality of the software, ensuring that it meets the desired standards and requirements. Thirdly, they enhance software security by identifying vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. Finally, these tools facilitate a smoother, more efficient development process, enabling developers to deliver high-quality products on time.

One of the static testing methods mentioned in Course 14 is code review. Code review involves systematically examining the source code of a software application to identify bugs, security flaws and other problems. It is usually carried out by peers or a designated team of developers who evaluate the code to ensure that it complies with coding standards, best practices and potential logical errors. Code reviews are essential to guarantee code quality, promote knowledge sharing between team members and prevent the introduction of defects in the software. They help maintain code consistency, improve software maintainability and foster a collaborative development environment. By detecting problems early in the development cycle, code reviews help to reduce the overall cost of software maintenance and improve the reliability of the final product.

# Task 3 : Security Certification

For the potential end-user/purchaser of the product, safety certification can offer several incentives, both good and bad. On the positive side, a certified product provides assurance of a certain level of safety, giving consumers confidence in the product's reliability and safety. It can be a signal of quality and reliability, helping users to make informed decisions about which products to buy. In addition, some certifications may also provide insurance or legal benefits in the event of a safety violation, thus mitigating potential risks for the end-user. On the other hand, some certifications can lead to complacency on the part of users, giving them a false sense of security and potentially making them less vigilant about other security measures.

From the point of view of the certification authority, whether vendor-funded or not-for-profit, there are various incentives. A vendor-funded certification authority may have an incentive to prioritize the interests of the company funding it, leading to conflicts of interest and biased assessments. This could compromise the credibility of certification and undermine consumer confidence. On the other hand, it could also receive financial benefits and support from vendors, ensuring its sustainability and growth. Non-profit certification authorities, while potentially less influenced by specific vendors, may face financial constraints and depend on public support. They may be motivated by the objective of ensuring consumer protection, fostering market confidence and promoting safety standards, which could enhance their credibility and reputation in the sector.

For the product manufacturer/designer, obtaining safety certification can have both positive and negative consequences. On the positive side, certification can improve the product's marketability and competitiveness, paving the way for wider distribution and increased sales. It can also demonstrate the manufacturer's commitment to quality and safety, creating a positive brand image and building customer loyalty. However, the certification process can be time-consuming and costly, requiring extensive testing and compliance with rigorous standards. In some cases, manufacturers may be forced to compromise on certain features or functionality to meet certification requirements, which may limit innovation and creativity.

In conclusion, while safety certification is an essential mechanism for ensuring product safety and boosting consumer confidence, it is essential to be aware of the potential biases and conflicts of interest that can arise from different perspectives. Balancing the interests of end-users, certification authorities and manufacturers is essential to maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of the certification process.

# Task 4 : Tietoturvamerkki

Tietoturvamerkki is a Finnish security certification program aimed at improving the level of data security and confidentiality in organizations and companies. Certification is awarded to organizations that meet specific security standards and requirements defined by the Finnish authorities. Tietoturvamerkki certification means that the organization has implemented robust security measures and practices to protect sensitive data and information from unauthorized access, breaches and other security threats.

Tietoturvamerkki's certification program underlines the importance of data protection and privacy in today's digital landscape. It encourages companies to adopt comprehensive security policies, procedures and technologies to protect their digital assets and maintain the trust of their customers. By achieving Tietoturvamerkki certification, companies can demonstrate their commitment to maintaining high standards of data security and privacy, enhancing their credibility and competitiveness in the marketplace.

Overall, Tietoturvamerkki plays an essential role in promoting a culture of security and responsible data management within Finnish companies. It is an invaluable reference for organizations striving to comply with Finnish data security standards.
