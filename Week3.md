## Task 1 : Lock-ins

A lock-on is when someone maintain an arrangement because of some reason that could make the change annoying or complex. There are 6 types of lock-in: Technical Lock-in, Economic Lock-in, Contractual Lock-in, Behavioral Lock-in, Data Lock-in and Network Lock-in. One common example of lock-in which was true few years ago is about mobile number. When we got a mobile number, we had to stay with the current operator to keep it. And even if someone else is offering a subscription cheaper or with more option, the fact that you had to change your mobile number made it very annoying. So, you would not change your subscription. Now, most of the time you can keep your phone number while changing the operator you are with. Another good example given in “Security Engineering Lecture 5: The Economics of Security” available on YouTube, is bank which do everything to get client when they are young by offering money at the opening of an account. As the procedure to change bank are very long and annoying, they are almost sure that the client will also ask the bank if he needs a loan or a specific insurance later in his life.
 
## Task2: Security Psychology

<b>Why are phishing attacks effective enough to be widespread practice?</b>

There are a lot of reason of why phishing is effective enough to be widespread practice but we can talk about two main reasons. Nowadays, phishing isn’t well known by most of the people. It means that people had probably never heard about this kind of attack and so, won’t beware about that. Even for people knowing phishing, it happens that the attack is so well done that you will be tricked by the email or whatever the hacker sent to you. 
A second reason is that it is a kind of attack that can worth a lot and in which the hacker almost doesn’t take any risks. They can operate anonymously, use disposable infrastructure, and frequently change tactics. Successful phishing attacks can result in significant financial gain, stolen data, or compromised systems, making the potential rewards high.

<b>Why social engineering works on people?</b>

Social engineering works thanks to a lot of psychological weakness exploited by wrong people. Social engineers are skilled at manipulating emotions, such as sympathy, guilt, or excitement. They craft stories and scenarios that elicit strong emotional responses, which can cloud an individual's judgment and decision-making. They also create a feel of emergency by manipulating the victim. This way, the victim can take a wrong decision without thinking enough because of the feeling of fear and need to do things fast. Another point which is quite similar to the one we saw on the previous part is that people are not aware of this kind of common social engineering tactics which make them vulnerable. 

<b>Why many people have hard time using passwords in secure way?</b>

The policy might be good when we think about password but the average person doesn’t want to struggle every time, he/she has to enter a password to access an account. A long password using a lot of different kind of character is hard to remember. So, the person won’t use a password longer than what is mandatory to register a website. 
To be secure, we should use different password for every account which require to remember many passwords. The average internet user has 240 online accounts that require a password (https://www.dashlane.com/) so imagine choosing different for each of them. This problem leads to the habit to use the same password for multiples account which is highly not recommended. 
To solve this problem, password managers can help users generate and securely store complex passwords for multiple accounts. However, not everyone uses these tools, either due to lack of awareness or reluctance to adopt new software.

<b>Why PGP fails to be effective way to secure email?</b>

PGD has too many defaults which make it hard to use for everyone. PGP relies on the adoption of encryption by both the sender and the recipient. If either party does not use PGP, messages cannot be encrypted end-to-end. 
PGP encrypts the content of emails but not the metadata, such as the sender and recipient's email addresses and subject lines. This metadata can still reveal sensitive information.
It can be complex to set up, especially for user which is not in tech. Another default is that most of the time, you have to add a software to secure your emails, it is almost never already integrated in email inbox. 

<b>Why it is so easy to spread malware?</b>

All we said about weak password earlier permit hackers to guess or find user’s password easily which make it even easier for spreading malware. Most of the time, when they found a password, they have access to couple of the user account.
Cybercriminals use automated tools and scripts to scan the internet for vulnerable systems. When they identify a vulnerable target, they can quickly launch attacks to deliver malware.
Malicious code can be injected into legitimate websites. When users visit these compromised sites, the malware is automatically downloaded to their devices without their knowledge or consent.
Malware can come from USB drives, external hard drives, and other removable media. When these devices are connected to multiple computers, the malware can spread to each connected system.

 
## Task 3A: Intellectual Rights

<b>Intellectual property (IP) :</b>

-	IP is about everything someone would create with his mind. It can be a concept, something artistic, literature or name coming from a public advertising.
-	A good way to protect these assets is patents. By owning patent, you own the right to be the only one to exploit this knowledge/tech. For example, PSA Group in France applied for 1239 patents in 2020 for different kind of innovation.

<b>Copyright :</b>

-	We usually hear about copyright when it comes to artistic domain such as music, painting of movies for example. This law makes it illegal to broadcast some content without the authorization of the creator. It is also true for innovation in tech. 
-	For example, in music industry, copyright continue for 70 years after creator’s dead. Which mean that we can use a music without asking or paying the heir only 70 years after creator’s dead. Until then, you have to pay the right to broadcast music. 

<b>Patent : </b>

-	As we said earlier, patent are a way to protect the right to build, use or sell an innovation. It means that while the patent is valid, only the owner can do these actions. It has limit of time and can be renewed but the owner has to pay every time for that is he wants to keep exclusivity. 
-	Same example as for Intellectual property where we already talked about patent.

<b>Trademark :</b>

-	It permits brand to be sure no one uses the same logo, name or symbol as it to be sure there are no fake of this brand.
-	For example, the famous ‘M’ from McDonald’s can’t be copy without being reprimanded.

<b>Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) :</b>

-	Non-Disclosure Agreements are contracts made when two compagnies works together to guaranty non-disclosure about specific technologies or knowledge. 
-	It is commonly used in military domain especially because it can be mandatory to keep some things confidential.

<b>Watermarks :</b>

-	Watermarks are elements added to digital media with the purpose of protecting intellectual property, authenticating documents, preventing unauthorized copying, identifying the source, or deterring users from violating copyrights. They are commonly used in various industries, including photography, online content distribution, and document security.
-	Photographers often use watermarks on their online images to prevent unauthorized downloads and usage.

<b>Software licenses : </b>

-	Licenses are made for user to be able to use only specifics functions in software. Usually the price of a license depend on what you need/want.
-	Last year, I needed a license to use a software named TIA Portal which permitted me to program Siemens automats so we had to ask the compagnie we were working for to buy one for us.

<b>Digital rights management (DRM) :</b>

-	Digital Rights Management (DRM) is a systematic approach to protecting digital content and intellectual property rights by controlling access to, copying of, and distribution of digital media and software. It's used to safeguard various forms of digital content, such as music, videos, e-books, software, and more. DRM technologies typically involve a combination of encryption, access controls, and licensing to enforce restrictions on how the content can be used.
-	Nowadays, a lot of streaming services as Netflix or Amazon Prime use it to prevent people from copying content and broadcasting it online for example.

<b>Software protection dongles :</b>

-	Software protection dongles are hardware devices designed to enhance the security of software applications by requiring the physical presence of the dongle to run the software. These dongles are typically small, USB-connected devices that contain encrypted keys or code necessary for the software to operate.
-	I can’t remember using one of these but it seems it is often use in CAO software to prevent from spreading.
 
## Task 3B: Freedom of Information
Other side of the coin, information wants to be free. Pick 2 safeguarding methods from previous part and Investigate and present real-world instances where the aforementioned safeguarding methods were bypassed, highlighting entities involved and the rationale behind their actions. Additionally, report on how they justify these circumventions. Answer in 400-500 word essay.

Back in the days, it was very easy to download content from a website named <i>zonetelechargement</i> which was in France the biggest illegal downloading website available. On this website we could find movies, shows, but also video games from multiple support (console and PC). Although it was illegal and everybody knew it, it was very popular and used because it was very easy to use and permitted the user to have access to almost everything for free. Obviously, some measures were taken to close this website but it was always able to come back using another domain as soon as the previous one was removed or blocked from internet. Most of the time, it was just changing the extension : .com; .eu; .du; .net… 

As it was almost impossible to stop people from downloading content on this website, a big ticket was sent to people who downloaded a lot. It was still in very few cases compare to the amount of user of the website. For example, someone who downloaded only one movie per week wasn’t considered as a big user so he could continue to download without taking any risks. 

At the same moment, it was very easy to find everything in illegal streaming. The only thing to do was to search for <i>nameofthemovie free streaming</i> and we could find dozen of website offering to see it for free. We could even find movie that was released few days ago thanks to someone who filmed the movies with his phone in a movie theater and posting it online. Of course, it was free for us but these kind of website use cookies and ad to make money without us noticing. 

Nowadays, a lot of work has been done to make disappear these website, and especially since big streaming platform emerged like Prime Video or Netflix. Now it’s almost impossible to find a streaming website for fresh movies and it’s even harder to download content for free. By removing the access to this kind of content, measures were taken to ensure Intellectual property and Copyright of the authors.
