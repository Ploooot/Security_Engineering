## Task 1A, Browsers and Banking Security

What does the "Not Secure" warning mean in the first picture and what risks does visiting sites with the warning pose?

The “Not Secure” warning means that the connection between the web browser and the site isn’t crypted so it might be not secure. Most of the time, it’s because the website doesn’t use HTTPS protocol.
By visiting not secure website, you take the risk to let someone intercept data between the website and you navigator. 

Why does the second site show up as "trusted" to the browser?

It means that the connection is crypted so the website is more or less safe.

What other ways are there to detect a phishing/scam site? Are there any tools available online?

We can look at the domain extension, if it is suspicious we should avoid to stay on this website. We can also use some tools as Google Safe Browsing. This kind of extension can warn us is we are visiting a website suspicious. 
The best thing is still to not go on a website coming from a link which we can not trust for sure.

What is typosquatting and how does it relate to the pictures?

Typosquatting is a cyberattack which consist of changing a small thing in a URL so the user thinks he is on the website he wants to but he is actually on a false one. If we look at the picture, we can see that the Not Secure website has a ‘k’ at the end of URL which is not suppose to be there and which indicate that it is not the true website. 

What is UDRP and how does it help with combatting typosquatting?
UDRP is a process which help legits domain owners to take legal action against fake owner website such as the one created with typosquatting. 

If you were to own the domain ouspg.org and would be running your crypto banking application at bank.ouspg.org, what domains could you monitor for warning signs of possible phishing attempts against your customers?

It would be good to look for website using a Cyrillic "а" instead of a Latin "a." We could also check for the domain extension because a user could trust a website with .net or .com as extension.

## Task 1B: Certificates

## Task 2, Personal Threat Model

Personally, I think my biggest vulnerability is my phone. It contains every simple information that could be used by a criminal such as my health, my bank account, where I go shopping or running… If someone wants to attack me, it would probably be from my mobile. We could separate the physical and the numerical aspects of my vision of how I could secure my advice and how I could react from an attack.

  -	Physical : First of all, my biggest flaw would be that I easily let the others use my phone for whatever they need. It means that if someone needs to make a call or wants to check his/her email or even if it’s just to play a music on a speaker, I would just give my phone unlock. To protect myself, I try to let only the people I really trust use my phone. It permit two things. The first one is that if I trust the person, he/she would probably not use my phone for something wrong. The other point is that if there is an issue afterward, I’m able to go see the person to discuss about what he/she did with my mobile.
  -	Numerical : To protect myself numerically, I usually don’t do a lot. I try to use different passwords for account I have. I never clink on a link in an email if I don’t know for sure the sender. Another thing is that I never have something that could be use to blackmail me in my phone. Except things like my bank account login information, which I’m able to change very easily by calling my bank, there is nothing that someone can use against me. If someone manage to enter my phone and get some access to my accounts, I would change my password and try to be in contact with the compagnies affected by that so they can block the access of the hacker to my information/files. 

## Task 3, Company Security Policy

### Task 3.1, Password policy

  -	When creating your password, make sure it is not the same as one you use for another account.
  -	Your password should have more than 9 characters which contains special character, number, uppercase and lowercase.
  -	Never communicate your password to someone.
  -	Never write your password where it can be read by someone else.

### Task 3.2, Social media security policy

  -	Never post confidential information on social medias.
  -	Don’t communicate any password, address, bank info or anything valuable by message.
  -	Don’t click on a link coming from someone you don’t know or if you are not sure about what it contains.
  -	Be aware that some of your friends account might have been hacked, so if you have doubts, try to verify you are talking to the good person or don’t answer until you are sure.
  -	Double check every pictures you would like to share to be sure that there is nothing inconvenient on it.

## Task 4A, Network scan

- Did you find devices you did not know were in your network?

No, I didn’t find any other devices in my network.

- Were there open ports which should have been closed?

I have only 3 open ports and the all have to be open for the communications of the computer.

- Did nmap find any vulnerabilities with the scripts?

No vulnerabilities have been found.

- Screenshot of the topology of your network. You can redact device information if you want.

My account details leaked but I already changed my password few month ago for another reason.

## Task 4C, Wazuh

## Feedback

For now, this course is only general culture and I don't think it's a bad thing because we need to be aware of what happens in the world about cybersecurity. 
I'm still waiting for the part of the course where we're going to learn skill and I hope it won't be too late. What we saw until now is interesting but it's only knowledge and not skills.
