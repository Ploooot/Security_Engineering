## Task 1, What measures have you taken to protect yourself from cyber crimes?

To fortify my defenses towards all sorts of cyber crimes, I took two measures. The first one is to use different password for every website I need to login. It might be hard to remember all of them but at least it doesn’t permit to connect to all of my accounts if a password is found. The second measure I took is to use an antivirus software that I trust. I think it protected me from some malware or virus when I tried to go on streaming websites. However, I do not try to do some check of my computer which is something I should do because I could have a virus and don’t notice it.

I received a lot of phishing emails and sometimes I wonder if it is actually one or if it’s safe. I have never been a victim of this because when I have a doubt I always search on internet if the sender of the email is a fake or not. If I wasn’t able to find out if it’s a fake email, I wouldn’t open it or click in the links that were in it.  

## Task 2, Personal Threat Model

Personally, I think my biggest vulnerability is my phone. It contains every simple information that could be used by a criminal such as my health, my bank account, where I go shopping or running… If someone wants to attack me, it would probably be from my mobile. We could separate the physical and the numerical aspects of my vision of how I could secure my advice and how I could react from an attack.

  -	Physical : First of all, my biggest flaw would be that I easily let the others use my phone for whatever they need. It means that if someone needs to make a call or wants to check his/her email or even if it’s just to play a music on a speaker, I would just give my phone unlock. To protect myself, I try to let only the people I really trust use my phone. It permit two things. The first one is that if I trust the person, he/she would probably not use my phone for something wrong. The other point is that if there is an issue afterward, I’m able to go see the person to discuss about what he/she did with my mobile.
  -	Numerical : To protect myself numerically, I usually don’t do a lot. I try to use different passwords for account I have. I never clink on a link in an email if I don’t know for sure the sender. Another thing is that I never have something that could be use to blackmail me in my phone. Except things like my bank account login information, which I’m able to change very easily by calling my bank, there is nothing that someone can use against me. If someone manage to enter my phone and get some access to my accounts, I would change my password and try to be in contact with the compagnies affected by that so they can block the access of the hacker to my information/files. 

## Task 3, Company Security Policy

### Task 3.1, Password policy

  -	When creating your password, make sure it is not the same as one you use for another account.
  -	Your password should have more than 9 characters which contains special character, number, uppercase and lowercase.
  -	Never communicate your password to someone.
  -	Never write your password where it can be read by someone else.

### Task 3.2, Social media security policy

  -	Never post confidential information on social medias.
  -	Don’t communicate any password, address, bank info or anything valuable by message.
  -	Don’t click on a link coming from someone you don’t know or if you are not sure about what it contains.
  -	Be aware that some of your friends account might have been hacked, so if you have doubts, try to verify you are talking to the good person or don’t answer until you are sure.
  -	Double check every pictures you would like to share to be sure that there is nothing inconvenient on it.

## Task 4A, Network scan

- Did you find devices you did not know were in your network?

No, I didn’t find any other devices in my network.

- Were there open ports which should have been closed?

I have only 3 open ports and the all have to be open for the communications of the computer.

- Did nmap find any vulnerabilities with the scripts?

No vulnerabilities have been found.

- Screenshot of the topology of your network. You can redact device information if you want.

## Task 4B, Account Security

My account details leaked but I already changed my password few month ago for another reason.

## Feedback

For now, this course is only general culture and I don't think it's a bad thing because we need to be aware of what happens in the world about cybersecurity. 
I'm still waiting for the part of the course where we're going to learn skill and I hope it won't be too late. What we saw until now is interesting but it's only knowledge and not skills.
